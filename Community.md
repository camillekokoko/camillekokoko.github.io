DDD Adelaide is a one-day, inclusive, non-profit conference that brings together the Adelaide software community for knowledge exchange and collaboration.

I really liked Sammy Herbert's talk! They were all about making sure more awesome women stick around and grow in techie jobs. Sammy knows the scoop, having thrown cool events for techie gals. They say, "Hey, we need everyone to cheer on our techie ladies!" It's like a big, fun team that helps boost and celebrate women in tech.
